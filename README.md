# Generating-High-Resolution-GAN-Faces
This notebook demonstrates how to run NVidia StyleGAN inside of a Google CoLab notebook. I suggest you use this to generate GAN faces from a pretrained model. If you try to train your own, you will run into compute limitations of Google CoLab.  This code is running on a GPU instance. GPU is assumed.

These two output images were generated:
